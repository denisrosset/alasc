AlaSc, it's Scala permuted!
===========================

AlaSc is a Computational Group Theory library aiming to implement
permutation group algorithms in Scala. The library implements the
deterministic and randomized Schreier-Sims algorithms using
explicit transversals, along with a few helpers.

It also provides a `Group` class which can be used to explore any finite
group provided a faithful action is provided.

The library is by no means complete, and the API is unstable for now.
